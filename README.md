This implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm aims to demonstrate network flow optimization on a graph implemented with nodes and vertices.
Most implementations of this algorithm found online are written for the adjacency matrix representation of a graph, which some may find more difficult to visualize.
This code is a work in progress.
