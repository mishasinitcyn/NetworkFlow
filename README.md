This implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm aims to demonstrate network flow optimization on a graph implemented with nodes and vertices.
Most implementations of this algorithm found online are written for the adjacency matrix representation of the graph, which is harder for new software developers to visualize.
Work in progress.
